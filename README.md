# joe-ecs
ECS library of the one and only Joe.

# What is it?
Joe ECS is an [Entity-Component-System](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) library made in C by me, [Average Joe](https://github.com/BoilerplateJoe/)

# Why is it?
Here's a simple list
- Very few pure C ECS libraries
- [Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs) is very good, but it's not what I want and it's somewhat confusing at times
- [destral_ecs](https://github.com/roig/destral_ecs) is suitable, but lacks certain features and is unmaintained

# Ideas taken
- [Matter](https://github.com/evaera/matter)
     - Seperation of powers
	      - World
		  - Loop
		  - Debugger

- [destral_ecs](https://github.com/roig/destral_ecs)/[entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)
     - Sparse set based ECS
